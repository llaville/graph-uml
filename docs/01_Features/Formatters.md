# Formatters

![Graph UML Formatter](./formatter.graphviz.svg)

[GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) allows two different formats to render vertex labels:

* [HtmlFormatter](https://github.com/llaville/graph-uml/blob/master/src/Formatter/HtmlFormatter.php) that present vertex labels as [HTML-like labels](https://github.com/graphp/graphviz#html-like-labels)
* [RecordFormatter](https://github.com/llaville/graph-uml/blob/master/src/Formatter/RecordFormatter.php) that present vertex label as [Record-based node](https://github.com/graphp/graphviz#record-based-nodes)
