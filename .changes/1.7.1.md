## 1.7.1 - 2025-08-19

### Changed

- renames namespace for PHP_CodeSniffer installation with Composer Bin Plugin from `php-cs` to `phpcs`
- do not forward command on Composer Udate|Install, to let a chance to install dev tools (into `vendor-bin/`) on demand
- reorganizes CaptainHook config files (`.config/captainhook/*`) and use `$ENV` placeholder rather than `custom` config with `$CONFIG` placeholder

### Fixed

- Git hooks installation with CaptainHook (see `vendor-bin/captainhook`) when running `composer update` or `composer install`
